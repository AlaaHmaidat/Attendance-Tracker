# Agile Methodology for Small Project (2-week Sprint) - 5 Developers

## 1. Project Vision and Goal Definition:
- **Vision:** Develop a small facial recognition-based attendance system for a specific use case.
- **Goals:** Streamline attendance tracking, improve accuracy, and ensure user satisfaction.

## 2. Product Backlog Creation:
- User Story 1: As an administrator, I want to capture attendance using facial recognition.
- User Story 2: As a user, I want to have a user-friendly interface to mark my attendance.
- User Story 3: As an administrator, I want to generate attendance reports.
- User Story 4: As a privacy-conscious organization, we want to implement privacy-preserving measures.

## 3. Sprint Planning (2-week Sprint):
- Selected User Stories: User Story 1, User Story 2, and User Story 3
- Development Team Capacity: 5 developers
- Effort Estimates: User Story 1 (3 points), User Story 2 (2 points), User Story 3 (4 points)

## 4. Daily Stand-up Meetings:
- Developers share their progress, plans, and any challenges faced.

## 5. Iterative Development and Testing:
- Developer 1 works on implementing the facial recognition algorithm and integration.
- Developer 2 focuses on developing the user interface for marking attendance.
- Developer 3 works on the attendance capturing functionality.
- Developer 4 focuses on generating attendance reports.
- Developer 5 contributes to privacy-preserving measures and system scalability.
- Developers conduct regular testing and gather feedback from the team to ensure accuracy and user satisfaction.

## 6. Sprint Review and Retrospective:
- **Sprint Review:** Developers demonstrate the completed functionalities to stakeholders, gather feedback, and make necessary adjustments.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** The team reflects on the sprint, identifies areas for improvement, and discusses potential enhancements for the next sprint.

## 7. Continuous Integration and Deployment:
- Developers integrate and test the codebase frequently.
- Automated deployment processes are set up to ensure smooth deployment of the system.

## 8. Privacy Assessments and Stakeholder Involvement:
- Conduct privacy assessments to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and address privacy concerns.
- Stakeholders, such as administrators and end user, are involved in feedback sessions and usability testing.
